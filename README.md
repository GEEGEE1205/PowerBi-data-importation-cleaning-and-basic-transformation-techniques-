## 📄 GitHub Report: Power BI Data Cleaning & Transformation Project

### 🧠 Project Title:

**Data Cleaning and Preparation using Power BI**

---

### 📌 Project Overview:

This project demonstrates foundational data transformation techniques using Microsoft Power BI. As part of my Power BI training, I worked through real-world scenarios involving importing raw data, performing essential cleaning tasks, and transforming it into a structured format suitable for analysis and reporting.

---

### 🔧 Tools & Environment:

* **Tool Used**: Microsoft Power BI Desktop
* **Techniques Applied**: Power Query (M Language), Data Model Configuration
* **File Format**: `.pbix`
* **Data Type**: Sample/raw tabular data (CSV/Excel simulated import)

---

### 📥 1. Data Importation:

I began by importing raw datasets into Power BI. Various formats were used to simulate real-world data sources.

**Key Actions:**

* Imported Excel/CSV files via the *Get Data* function.
* Combined multiple tables using *Append Queries* (if used).
* Explored the data preview using *Power Query Editor*.

### 🧹 2. Data Cleaning & Transformation:

Data cleaning was the core focus of this project, using Power Query Editor.

**Transformations Performed**:

| Task                         | Description                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Removed Columns**          | Removed irrelevant columns to reduce noise                                                 |
| **Renamed Columns**          | Applied meaningful names to aid clarity                                                    |
| **Replaced Values**          | Standardized inconsistent text values (e.g., replacing `N/A` or `null` with valid entries) |
| **Filtered Rows**            | Removed unwanted entries based on specific criteria                                        |
| **Changed Data Types**       | Ensured numerical, date, and text values had the correct types                             |
| **Created Custom Columns**   | Added new derived columns to enhance data                                                  |
| **Sorted Data**              | Organized data for better visualization logic                                              |
| **Trimmed and Cleaned Text** | Removed unnecessary white spaces and hidden characters                                     |

### 🧮 3. Data Modeling:

To ensure efficient analysis:

* Established relationships (if multiple tables existed).
* Ensured all columns used in visuals were properly referenced and structured.

---

### 📊 4. Report View & Table Visualization:

A clean tabular report was created using the **Table** visual to display the final transformed dataset.

**Design Elements:**

* Easy-to-read table layout
* Clean headers with consistent naming
* Sorting applied to aid readability

---

### 📘 Key Learnings:

Through this hands-on project, I gained confidence in:

* Navigating Power Query Editor
* Performing foundational data cleaning steps
* Understanding the role of clean data in visualization
* Structuring datasets for accurate reporting

---

### 🧠 Skills Demonstrated:

* Data Importation
* Data Cleaning Techniques
* Power Query Transformation Logic
* Table Design in Power BI
* Data Type Management
* Column Management (Rename, Remove, Add, Replace)

---

### 🔗 Next Steps:

This foundation will support future learning around:

* DAX calculations
* Interactive dashboards
* Slicers, filters, and KPIs
* Visual storytelling using Power BI visuals
