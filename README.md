### Power BI Data Cleaning & Transformation 

**Overview**:

This project demonstrates foundational data transformation techniques using Microsoft Power BI. As part of my Power BI training, I worked through real-world scenarios involving ETL (Extraction of data,Transformation and Loading of data for modeling and Visualization suitable for analysis and reporting.

---

 **Tools & Environment**:

   - Tool Used: Microsoft Power BI Desktop
   - Techniques Applied: Power Query (M Language), Data Model Configuration
   - File Format: '.pbix'
   - Data Type: Sample/raw tabular data (CSV/Excel simulated import)

---

1. **Data Importation**:

  - I began by importing raw datasets into Power BI. Various formats were used to simulate real-world data sources.

**Key Actions:**

   - Imported Excel/CSV files via the (Get Data) function.
   - Combined multiple tables using (Append Queries) .
   - Explored the data preview using Power Query Editor.

---

2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**:

   -  Data cleaning was the core focus of this project, using Power Query Editor.

  - **Transformations Performed**:
                                                                             
      - **Removed Columns** :          Removed irrelevant columns to reduce noise                                                 
      - **Renamed Columns** :         Applied meaningful names to aid clarity                                                    
      - **Replaced Values** :          Standardized inconsistent text values (e.g., replacing 'N/A' or 'null' with valid entries) 
      - **Filtered Rows**   :          Removed unwanted entries based on specific criteria                                        
      - **Changed Data Types** :       Ensured numerical, date, and text values had the correct types                             
      - **Created Custom Columns**:    Added new derived columns to enhance data                                                  
      - **Sorted Data** :              Organized data for better visualization logic                                              
      - **Trimmed and Cleaned Text**:  Removed unnecessary white spaces and hidden characters

3. **Data Modeling**:

 - To ensure efficient analysis:

    - Established relationships .
    - Ensured all columns used in visuals were properly referenced and structured.

---

4. **Report View & Table Visualization**:

      - A clean tabular report was created using the (Table) visual to display the final transformed dataset.

   - **Design Elements**:

      - Easy-to-read table layout
      - Clean headers with consistent naming
      - Sorting applied to aid readability

---

- **Key Learnings**:

- Through this hands-on project, I gained confidence in:

  - Navigating Power Query Editor
  - Performing foundational data cleaning steps
  - Understanding the role of clean data in visualization
  - Structuring datasets for accurate reporting

---

- **Skills Demonstrated**:

   - Data Importation
   - Data Cleaning Techniques
   - Power Query Transformation Logic
   - Table Design in Power BI
   - Data Type Management
   - Column Management (Rename, Remove, Add, Replace)

---

- **Next Steps**:

  - DAX calculations
  - Interactive dashboards
  - Slicers, filters, and KPIs
  - Visual storytelling using Power BI visuals
